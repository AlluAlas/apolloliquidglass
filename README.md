# Balackburn's Apollo with Liquid Glass

This method was made possible thanks to [ryannair05](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/Apollo-ImprovedCustomApi/issues/63) who explained how he achieved this with Apollo on iOS 26 beta 2. I simply made the IPA file for you all and using the latest version.

### Steps to replicate:
1. Download the latest Apollo IPA from [Balackburn](https://github.com/Balackburn/Apollo/releases).  
2. Change the extension from `.ipa` to `.zip` and extract it.  
3. Open **Terminal**, `cd` into the extracted `Payload` folder, and run:  

   ```bash
   codesign --remove-signature Apollo.app/Apollo
   vtool -set-build-version ios 15.0 19.0 -replace -output Apollo.app/Apollo Apollo.app/Apollo
   install_name_tool -delete_rpath "@executable_path/Frameworks" Apollo.app/Apollo

4. Compress the Payload folder again, rename from .zip to .ipa, and sideload it.

I also created and included a tweak as a fix for the constant crashes when using Compact Mode and collapsing comments with images. It should be more stable now. If anyone knows Balackburn, tell him Iâ€™d like him to take a look at this so that, if he wants, he can implement it in his app and everyone can enjoy this together instead of being split.
